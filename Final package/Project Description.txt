In this project, we improved the example, warpPerspectivedemo.cpp, to let it 
could be able to deal with video.
warpPerspectivedemo.cpp can do perspective transformation applied on an image.
When the users select an area, this program will warp the image in this area
into a rectangle shape.
What we do in this project is changing the input to video, so the program will
able to cut out an part of the video and do perspective transformation.
