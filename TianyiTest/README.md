Based on David's work I archieved cutting a rectangle shape of video from the original video, the code is cut2.cpp.
Now I want to make some changes on the example, to let the input of it be a video. The problem I meet is, after the change, the program will get the first frame of the video but never come out of the while loop (while (!endProgram)), I don't have too much knowledge about this part, would you mind give me a hand?
