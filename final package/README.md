# Project Name
Perspective transformation for video

# Code
ReadVideoFunctions.cpp is a small library that provides a function to open a video given its filename and another function to play this video which also allows the user to change the frame rate.

warpPerspectiveDemo.cpp is an example code of OpenCV that we have decided to use as base for our project. This code takes as input an image and through the mouse it is possible to select a portion of it. The portion then goes through a perspective transformation and the output is shown in a new window.

Usage.cpp is an example of how to use the two functions.
