# Sami's Test Folder

This is a directory I'm using to practice using github. I'm going to try to push it to a branch called "Sami Edits".

# Corners2

This is an eclipse project including some examples I ran.
The script "Sami_harris_contour.cpp" includes my attempt to find the corner points of a notebook on a table.
